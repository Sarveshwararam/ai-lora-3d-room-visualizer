AI-Driven Diffusion and LoRA Models for Customizable 3D Room Visualization

##Overview
This project explores how Diffusion Models and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) can be combined to make 3D room design intuitive, customizable, and accessible. It enables users to generate, visualize, and iteratively refine room layouts using natural language, sketches, or mood boards as input.
The system supports real-time, photorealistic 3D rendering and allows interactive customization — empowering both professionals and non-experts to design creative spaces quickly and accurately.

##Objectives
-Develop an AI-driven 3D visualization tool that merges Diffusion and LoRA models.
-Support multimodal input — text, sketches, and mood boards.
-Provide real-time customization and refinement.
-Generate high-quality photorealistic outputs with minimal latency.
-Enhance accessibility for users with no 3D modeling experience.

##System Architecture:
#Core Components:

-User Interface (UI):
   --Handles text, sketch, and mood board input.
   --Displays interactive 3D visualization.

-Input Processing Module:
   --Uses NLP and computer vision to interpret user input.

-Diffusion Model:
   --Generates the base 3D room layout.

-LoRA Customization Module:
   --Enables real-time fine-tuning of furniture, textures, and lighting.

-Rendering Engine:
   --Produces photorealistic renders and supports export to .fbx, .obj, .png, etc.

-Backend Services:
   --Manage users, sessions, and cloud integration.
